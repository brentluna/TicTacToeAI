# Tic-tac-toe AI

Terminal based TicTacToe, where the computer AI will not lose.

## Technologies

- Ruby

I implemented a breadth first search for the AI, in order for it to check all possible moves and pick the appropriate move that won't allow the human player to win. Depending on the moves the computer player makes, the AI should either win, or create a cats-game.
